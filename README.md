# GadgetHub
The Gadget Hub is a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)–based application designed for an online gadget marketplace. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms, The Gadget Hub does not maintain its own inventory. Instead, it integrates with three distributors – TechWorld, ElectroCom, and Gadget Central – to provide customers with the latest gadgets at the best available prices.
